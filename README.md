# portfolio-page

In this project I demonstrate my knowledge of  HTML + CSS to build a Portfolio page. There's lots of CSS Flexbox, and responsive design too!

Make the page narrower to see the responsiveness!

This is a project from the freeCodeCamp HTML + CSS tutorials. See the project brief here: https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage
